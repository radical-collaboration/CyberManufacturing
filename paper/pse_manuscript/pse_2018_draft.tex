\begin{abstract}
A multiscale model combines the computational efficiency of a macro-scale model and the
accuracy of a micro-scale model. It is preferred over a fully micro-scale model for its speed advantages while maintaining the physics 
of the problem. A less accurate way to perform such a simulation is touse data from a precomputed microscale model in a macroscale 
model. With the current cyberinfrastructure resources available, using more computationally intensive and concurrent multiscale models 
are morefeasible. This study proposes to use Discrete Element Method (DEM), a microscale model, and a Population Balance Model (PBM), 
a macroscale model, in a concurrent manner to model the granulation process of a pharmaceutical product inside a high shear 
granulator. The granulation between the components of a pharmaceutical blend is governed by the collision in between the particles. 
This leads to increase in their size, due to physical bonds in between them. The DEM provides the collision data while the PBM helps 
in predicting the macroscale phenomena like aggregation and breakage. This work attempts to couple these two models using a controller 
program, which triggers the DEM first, to give initial seed data to run the PBM. Then, the controller uses the data generated from the 
PBM continuously to determine the change in the physical properties and trigger the DEM from its last known state. The controller does 
the same with the DEM data to trigger the PBM. This occurs iteratively until a steady state is reached. A workflow diagram of the 
procedure followed is provided in Figure 1. The execution of each of the components is governed by a multilevel job scheduler which 
allocates resources rather than waiting for each simulation to run on a
normal job scheduler on a cluster. The DEM is parallelized using Message Parsing Interface (MPI) while the PBM is parallelized using a 
faster hybrid approach which is a combination of both MPI and Open Multi-Processing (OMP). Since the DEM is computationally heavy, an 
algorithm is developed to utilize the idle cores during the PBM execution to run multiple instances of the PBM such that parameter 
estimation of the kernels of the PBM occurs on the fly as well. This method of using shorter bursts of each simulation led to faster 
simulation times as well as a more accurate model of the high shear granulator. The Quality by Design (QbD) approach is addressed 
using such a modelling framework and it also helps us understand the
granulation process in a quantitative as well as in a mechanistic manner. \citep{Reference2015}
