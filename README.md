# CyberManufacturing
CDSE Multi-scale CI Project 

Cyber-Manufacturing aims to establish a faster methodology for quicker simulations of particulate processes being used in the pharmaceutical industry using the High Performance Computing Infrastructure available. The nascent Quality by Design (QbD) concept being practiced in the industry can benefit from such an implementation since it not only helps in faster simulations and better modelling of these processes but also can be used for on-line measurements and control of these processes. This leads to better product quality and less waste being generated from the process.

departments of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.
